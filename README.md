# Rails API (back end) for BookSwap.io

As the project name hints at, the idea is to build a platform for people to trade books. Specifically though, it would be for technical books and textbooks.

* Current Gem Dependencies:
 ruby-2.6.1
 rails-6.0.0

 Other than the regular Rails dependencies:
 * bcrypt -- user password hashing
 * jwt -- token authentication
 * rack-cors -- to manage cross-origin resource sharing
 * pg - to utilize PostgreSQL as the Database Management System.
 
* Deployment instructions
  None yet, hoping to get it hosted soon.

* Repo for React App (front end) for BookSwap.io can be found [here](https://github.com/brunogarciagonzalez/bookswap-react)
