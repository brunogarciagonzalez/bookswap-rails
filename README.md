# Rails API (back end) for BookSwap.io

As the project name hints at, the idea is to build a platform for people to trade books. Specifically though, it would be for technical books and textbooks.

### Current Gem Dependencies:
 * `ruby-2.6.1`
 * `rails-6.0.0`
 * `bcrypt-3.1.13` -- user password hashing
 * `jwt-2.2.1` -- token authentication
 * `rack-cors-1.0.3` -- to manage cross-origin resource sharing
 * `pg-1.1.4` - to utilize PostgreSQL as the Database Management System.
 
### Deployment instructions
  None yet, hoping to get it hosted soon.
